_Gravedigger: Dark Ritual_ is an old-school adventure game that combines elements of classic adventure role-playing games (RPGs) like puzzles, traps, and combat with a modern rogue-like twist involving a repeating time loop.

The game is set in a dark fantasy world where, unknown to the nearby humble village, an evil wizard has been planning for a dark ritual that will summon an ancient evil from the abyss beyond. The ritual requires a Blood Moon, and while the townsfolk are celebrating with their Lunar Festival, dark deeds are afoot in the nearby catacombs.

Play as Caelum, the town's gravedigger, an acolyte of a long-forgotten order of clerics who protect the realm of the living from the realm of the undying. To hunt down the wizard and stop the ritual, you'll need to sacrifice everything - even your own soul - to prevent the ancient evil from being unleashed upon the world.

## Features

- **Classic RPG elements**: Explore a dark fantasy world filled with traps, puzzles, and combat with various monsters, undead, and horrors from the abyss beyond.
- **Modern roguelite twist**: Bound to the ritual by a cursed blade, embrace the power of a repeating time loop to learn from your mistakes and try new strategies to stop the wizard and prevent the ritual. Some sacred artifacts may be powerful enough to travel back with you to the start of the loop; most will not.
- **Echoes of the past**: When you die, your essence returns to the start of the ritual, but your bloodstain and the echo of your ghostly form remain. Leverage these bloodstains and echoes in subsequent loops to help you solve puzzles, avoid traps, and navigate the collapsing catacombs.
