> A mediocre top down shooter that's like if Asteroids and a bullet-hell game both had weird cousins that liked to hang out and they got drunk one weekend and decided to make their own game.

This was my first time trying to build a game. It was built over 3 days for [Ludum Dare 35](https://web.archive.org/web/20190223073330/http://ludumdare.com/compo/2016/04/13/welcome-to-ludum-dare-35/).

It used CreateJS and Electron as well as two custom JavaScript libraries I made for HTML5 game development:

- [gamepadder](https://github.com/DVDAGames/gamepadder) - HTML GamePad API button mappings for various controllers
- [buttonmancer](https://github.com/DVDAGames/buttonmancer) - Mapping and re-mapping of actions to specific inputs on gamepads or keyboards

**Note**: `gamepadder` and `buttonmancer` are no longer maintained as browser support for gamepads has improved and my own work on JavaScript game development has shifted to GameMaker Studio and Godot.
